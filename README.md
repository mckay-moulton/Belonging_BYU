# Belonging_BYU
R-Scripts that help organize, clean, analyze, and understand belonging at BYU, particularly as it relates to ethnic groups. 1400+ surveys from dozens of participants over the course of the 2022 Fall semester were used.
Initial cleaning script and excel file are not included, as they contain sensitive data (such as names and lcoations of survey respondants)

A couple ML scripts were created as well, however, most variables proved to be poor statistically indicators, in part because of the high correlation between negative emotions variables.
